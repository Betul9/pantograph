## Object Localization for Detecting The Horn Regions on Pantographs

The repository contains my work that is done for accomplishing object localization. Since my prior knowledge was not enough to reveal an excellent job, the results are not good enough and need to be evaluated more for understanding the problematic parts of the work.

The work is accomplished on COLAB environment. The training process has been done and the weights are saved to '.pth' file inside DATASET/models path. You can use the images inside 'DATASET' folder to make a detection. The code blocks, that should be run for the detection, are marked with a comment line as 'RUN 1,2..' at the top of the related cells.

I have also added the labels of the images just to show some examples. 

The .csv file inside the 'DATASET' folder contains information of the preprocessed version of the real frames. The training process is done based on the csv file.

(The limited number of the images is due to keeping the repository public. Since the dataset is provided by an institution, I could just provide some examples on GitHub environment.)
